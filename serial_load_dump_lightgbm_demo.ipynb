Specifically, the model stops training when the validation error fails to improve over a given number of *n* iterations. This approach ensures computational efficiency while guarding against overfitting. Setting the early stopping criteria too low could compromise model performance, making it vulnerable to premature termination due to fluctuating error gradients. Conversely, a number too high enhances the risk of overfitting to training data. To run the model on the same data set while adjusting early stopping criteria and number of iterations, change the attributes of class *CustomLightgbmParams* found in **load_dump_lightgbm.py**. There is no need to use the *load_data* method again; simply reinitialize *myModel* as outlined above.\n",

The graph presents both training and validation errors, allowing for a nuanced understanding of the model's performance. Notably, the y-axis is set on a logarithmic scale, which helps in capturing the nuances of error reduction across iterations more effectively. The observed error gradient is notably negative in early iterations, leveling off to approach zero with increasing iterations. In contrast, the training gradient tends to stabilize over an extended number of iterations. These patterns emphasize the need for early stopping criteria to mitigate the risk of overfitting the training data. The large deviation between validation error and training error also signal inconsistent relations between features and output labels in the data set."

Essentially, features that contribute the most to information gain, or have the most negative impact on the error gradient, are used more frequently for splitting.

Each feature (e.g. speed) is replicated *group_size* times to not lose any information regarding the data points that are grouped together into one.
