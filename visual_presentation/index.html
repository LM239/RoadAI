    <h3 class="left-aligned-text">Competition Description</h3>
    <p class="left-aligned-text">
      The RoadAI competition aims to reduce emissions in road construction. 1.5% of Norwegian CO2 emission resides
      from construction machines. The Norwegian Artificial Intelligence Research Consortium (NORA) hosts the
      competition,
      in collaboration with Skanska, Sintef, Nordic Machine Intelligence Journal, and several other partners.
      Kicking
      off in June 2023, the competition has run for three months, ending on the 10th of September. The overall aim
      of
      the competition is to demonstrate how road construction can become more sustainable through the
      use of data.
      <br>
      <br>
      Skanska has provided the participants with real machine data mainly recorded in March, April, and May in
      2022.
      The data stems from the construction of the E16 highway, between Bjørum and Skaret, just west of Oslo. There
      are
      four main components in the data set; GPS data, machine data (AEMP), vibration data, and drone photos.

    <h3>
      Our Approach
    </h3>
    <p class="left-aligned-text">
      Team NoDig's approach has been founded on a desire to develop feasible tools for automated decision support.
      A necessary first step has been the preprocessing of raw data. Any successful data analysis or machine
      learning model relies on relevant, representative, and usable input of data. Part one in the next section will
      elaborate on how we have preprocessed the raw data. Part two demonstrates how we have automated the load and
      dump activities of the machines. Finally, part three of our algorithm demonstrates the automated generation
      of a daily report.
    </p>
    <h2>The Algorithm</h2>
    <h3>
      Part one: Data Preprocessing
    </h3>
    <p class="left-aligned-text">
      GPS data has been our main source for input to each algorithm. From the initial CSV files we have created
      intuitive and usable classes that allows for analysis and machine learning. It is also simple to add new features
      (i.e. covariates) to the classes. The parts that follow will be built from the original GPS data. Attemps to
      include machine and vibration data has been made, but with unreliable results. We will instead provide remarks and
      brief discussions where we would have liked to make use of the mentioned data.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Part two: Automatic Load and Dump Detection with LightGBM
    </h3>
    <p class="left-aligned-text">
      Loading and dumping of trucks and dumpers has been performed manually by drivers in our data. There appear to be
      varying definitions of when loading and dumping occurs exactly. At the same time, a driver can forget to report
      an activity, leaving mistakes and reducing overall data quality. In the long term, one should aim to reduce the
      need for manual registration of data. This should improve data consistency and ultimately enhance the potential of
      any analysis or model that is founded on the data. It will also reduce the driver's need to interact with the
      device during trips, which in turn should have a positive effect on overall efficiency.
      <br>
      <br>
      We assume there is a continuous stream of data from the device in some machine. We do not make any assumptions
      about the frequency of these recored points, but assume that every point can be classified as "Driving", "Loading"
      or "Dumping". Our aim has been to classify each point as it has come through, on the basis of available data up
      until that given point. There is, by definition, one single loading point and one single dumping point per trip.
      The rest of the recordings are considered to be "driving" points. The number of such points varies per trip, but
      we typically observe more than 100 and less than 1000 points.
      <br>
      <br>
      As previously mentioned, the drivers seem to register a dump and load at various times, e.g. when stopping to
      load, or when finished loading. Individual differences between the drivers, coupled with GPS inaccuracy makes it
      difficult to spot the exact point the driver records an activity. Therefore, we argue that one could merge
      consecutive points and base our classification on that. This provide the classification with robustness and
      generalizes better between drivers and machines.

    <h3>
      Part three: Daily Report
    </h3>
    <p class="left-aligned-text">
      Taking advantage of the avilable GPS data, mass quantities, and type of mass moved, we have developed a report
      displaying the daily progress at the construction site. The report includes an interactive plot, idle time
      statistics, and productivity information per machine per material type. The report is generated automatically
      for a chosen day. In the interactive map, the user can select machine type, and the amount of clusters for dump
      and load regions to display. Drone images from Skaret and Nordlandsdalen are overlayed in the map for better
      visuals on how the region changes over time as construction progresses. An aglomerate clustering and convex
      hull algorithm is used to plot polygons of load and dump regions. The ineractive plot informs on quantity moved
      between regions, the top workers of the day (tonnes/hr), and total mass moved for each material type.
      The idle time statistics shows the amount of machines idle or active at different times of the day, and the
      amount of machines waiting for a load or dump. For the times of the day when most machines are idle, the
      position of idle machines are displayed on a map, showcasing common idle regions as a heatmap. The productivity
      information shows the average amount of tonnes mass moved per hour for each machine ID. One plot for each
      material type.
